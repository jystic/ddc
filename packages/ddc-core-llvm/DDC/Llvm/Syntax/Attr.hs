-- FuncAttr ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Function attributes are set to communicate additional information about a
--   function. Function attributes are considered to be part of the function,
--   not of the function type, so functions with different parameter attributes
--   can have the same function type. Functions can have multiple attributes.
--
--   Descriptions taken from <http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fnattrs>
data FuncAttr
        -- | The inliner should attempt to inline this function into callers
        --   whenever possible, ignoring any active inlining size threshold for
        --   this caller.
        = AlwaysInline

        -- | The source code contained a hint that inlining this function is
        --   desirable (such as the \"inline\" keyword in C/C++). 
        --   It is just a hint; it imposes no requirements on the inliner.
        | InlineHint

        -- | The inliner should never inline this function in any situation. 
        --   This attribute may not be used together with the alwaysinline attribute.
        | NoInline

        -- | Suggests that optimization passes and code generator passes make choices
        --   that keep the code size of this function low, and otherwise do
        --   optimizations specifically to reduce code size.
        | OptSize

        -- | The function never returns normally. 
        --   This produces undefined behavior at runtime if the function ever does
        --   dynamically return.
        | NoReturn

        -- | The function never returns with an unwind or exceptional control flow. 
        --   If the function does unwind, its runtime behavior is undefined.
        | NoUnwind

        -- | The function computes its result (or decides to unwind an exception) 
        --   based strictly on its arguments, without
        --   dereferencing any pointer arguments or otherwise accessing any mutable
        --   state (e.g. memory, control registers, etc) visible to caller functions.
        --   It does not write through any pointer arguments (including byval
        --   arguments) and never changes any state visible to callers. This means
        --   that it cannot unwind exceptions by calling the C++ exception throwing
        --   methods, but could use the unwind instruction.
        | ReadNone

        -- | The function does not write through any
        --   pointer arguments (including byval arguments) or otherwise modify any
        --   state (e.g. memory, control registers, etc) visible to caller functions.
        --   It may dereference pointer arguments and read state that may be set in
        --   the caller. A readonly function always returns the same value (or unwinds
        --   an exception identically) when called with the same set of arguments and
        --   global state. It cannot unwind an exception by calling the C++ exception
        --   throwing methods, but may use the unwind instruction.
        | ReadOnly

        -- | The function should emit a stack smashing protector. 
        --   It is in the form of a \"canary\"â€”a random value placed on the
        --   stack before the local variables that's checked upon return from the
        --   function to see if it has been overwritten. A heuristic is used to
        --   determine if a function needs stack protectors or not.
        --   If a function that has an ssp attribute is inlined into a function that
        --   doesn't have an ssp attribute, then the resulting function will have an
        --   ssp attribute.
        | Ssp

        -- | The function should always emit a stack smashing protector. 
        --   This overrides the ssp function attribute.
        --   If a function that has an sspreq attribute is inlined into a function
        --   that doesn't have an sspreq attribute or which has an ssp attribute,
        --   then the resulting function will have an sspreq attribute.
        | SspReq

        -- | The code generator should not use a red zone, even if the
        --   target-specific ABI normally permits it.
        | NoRedZone

        -- | Disables implicit floating point instructions.
        | NoImplicitFloat

        -- | Disables prologue / epilogue emission for the function.
        --   This can have very system-specific consequences.
        | Naked
        deriving (Eq, Show)


-- ParamAttr --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Parameter attributes are used to communicate additional information about
--   the result or parameters of a function
data ParamAttr
        -- | That the parameter or return value should be zero-extended to a 32-bit value
        --   by the caller (for a parameter) or the callee (for a return value).
        = ZeroExt

        -- | The parameter or return value should be sign-extended to a 32-bit value
        --   by the caller (for a parameter) or the callee (for a return value).
        | SignExt

        -- | The parameter or return value should be treated in a special target-dependent
        --   fashion during while emitting code for a function call or return (usually,
        --   by putting it in a register as opposed to memory).
        | InReg

        -- | The pointer parameter should really be passed by value to the function.
        | ByVal

        -- | The pointer parameter specifies the address of a structure that is the
        --   return value of the function in the source program.
        | SRet

        -- | The pointer does not alias any global or any other parameter.
        | NoAlias

        -- | The callee does not make any copies of the pointer that outlive the callee itself.
        | NoCapture

        -- | The pointer parameter can be excised using the trampoline intrinsics.
        | Nest
        deriving (Eq, Show)


-- CallConvention ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Different calling conventions a function can use.
data CallConv
        -- | The C calling convention.
        --   This calling convention (the default if no other calling convention is
        --   specified) matches the target C calling conventions. This calling
        --   convention supports varargs function calls and tolerates some mismatch in
        --   the declared prototype and implemented declaration of the function (as
        --   does normal C).
        = CC_Ccc

        -- | This calling convention attempts to make calls as fast as possible
        --   (e.g. by passing things in registers). This calling convention allows
        --   the target to use whatever tricks it wants to produce fast code for the
        --   target, without having to conform to an externally specified ABI
        --   (Application Binary Interface). Implementations of this convention should
        --   allow arbitrary tail call optimization to be supported. This calling
        --   convention does not support varargs and requires the prototype of al
        --   callees to exactly match the prototype of the function definition.
        | CC_Fastcc

        -- | This calling convention attempts to make code in the caller as efficient
        --   as possible under the assumption that the call is not commonly executed.
        --   As such, these calls often preserve all registers so that the call does
        --   not break any live ranges in the caller side. This calling convention
        --   does not support varargs and requires the prototype of all callees to
        --   exactly match the prototype of the function definition.
        | CC_Coldcc

        -- | Any calling convention may be specified by number, allowing
        --   target-specific calling conventions to be used. Target specific calling
        --   conventions start at 64.
        | CC_Ncc Int

        -- | X86 Specific 'StdCall' convention. LLVM includes a specific alias for it
        --   rather than just using CC_Ncc.
        | CC_X86_Stdcc

        -- | Not really a calling convention. Denotes that a function is a built-in
        -- LLVM intrinsic function and LLVM can optimise its use however it wants.
        | CC_Intrinsic
        deriving (Eq, Show)


-- LlvmLinkageType --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Linkage type of a symbol.
--
--   The description of the constructors is copied from the Llvm Assembly Language
--   Reference Manual <http://www.llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#linkage>, because
--   they correspond to the Llvm linkage types.
data Linkage
        -- | Global values with internal linkage are only directly accessible by
        --  objects in the current module. In particular, linking code into a module
        --  with an internal global value may cause the internal to be renamed as
        --  necessary to avoid collisions. Because the symbol is internal to the
        --  module, all references can be updated. This corresponds to the notion
        --  of the @static@ keyword in C.
        = Internal

        -- | Globals with @linkonce@ linkage are merged with other globals of the
        --  same name when linkage occurs. This is typically used to implement
        --  inline functions, templates, or other code which must be generated
        --  in each translation unit that uses it. Unreferenced linkonce globals are
        --  allowed to be discarded.
        | LinkOnce

        -- | @weak@ linkage is exactly the same as linkonce linkage, except that
        --  unreferenced weak globals may not be discarded. This is used for globals
        --  that may be emitted in multiple translation units, but that are not
        --  guaranteed to be emitted into every translation unit that uses them. One
        --  example of this are common globals in C, such as @int X;@ at global
        --  scope.
        | Weak

        -- | @appending@ linkage may only be applied to global variables of pointer
        --  to array type. When two global variables with appending linkage are
        --  linked together, the two global arrays are appended together. This is
        --  the Llvm, typesafe, equivalent of having the system linker append
        --  together @sections@ with identical names when .o files are linked.
        | Appending

        -- | The semantics of this linkage follow the ELF model: the symbol is weak
        --  until linked, if not linked, the symbol becomes null instead of being an
        --  undefined reference.
        | ExternWeak

        -- | The symbol participates in linkage and can be used to resolve external
        --   symbol references.
        | ExternallyVisible

        -- | Alias for 'ExternallyVisible' but with explicit textual form in LLVM
        --   assembly.
        | External
        deriving (Eq, Show)


-- CallType -------------------------------------------------------------------
-- | Different ways to call a function.
data CallType
        -- | Normal call, allocate a new stack frame.
        = CallTypeStd

        -- | Tail call, perform the call in the current stack frame.
        | CallTypeTail
        deriving (Eq, Show)
